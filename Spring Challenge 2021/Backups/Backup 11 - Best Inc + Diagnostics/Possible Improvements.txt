Improve growSunCover() for trees having/reaching maxTreeSize:
    a) For loss of suns, moreDays = Player.moreDays - Player.myCompleteDays

Accurate sun computation:
    a) Track a day's total IncHeur planned sun -> Stop excessive seeding  [controls incHeur]
    b) IncGrow should work with sunAhead -> computeSunAhead() in IncHeur  [increases incHeur chance]
	
	Post-effect: minProfit could be made 0 -> Choice of planting 0 length seed is avoided in SimpleHeur

End game better tree completion:  [natural way to stop end game seeding]
    a) Reserve day-by-day sun for completion of each tree
    b) Allow seedIncHeur to use completion reserve of a tree only if greater "suns" promised

IncPartHeur
    - Partial grow heuristics  [gain from some small trees in the end]

Debate:
    Is adding growCost[.] in growCost() a good idea?
    After all, if you plan on growing a tree to full, u would need to spend that much sun "sooner or later" anyway.

    Resolutions:
        What would be a more accurate measure?
            -> e.g., end game growing is not 0 growCost
        Experimental resolution: enableGrowCost flag  (adds growCost[.] if true)
            -> false gives better result

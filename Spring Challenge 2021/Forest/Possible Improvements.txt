myCompleteSeedCost Fixes:
    a) serr myCompleteSun and myCompleteSeedCost
    b) account for seedPlan.size() while choosing seeding option from allActions
        [peek next option and compare.]
        [next option might be another seed. then compare accordingly]

Tree cover fixes:
    -> a small size opp tree next to my full size tree WILL usually grow to full size. So, sunCover must be greater.

End game better tree completion:
    Plan A: [natural way to stop end game seeding]
        a) Reserve day-by-day sun for completion of each tree
        b) Allow seedIncHeur to use completion reserve of a tree only if greater "suns" promised
                [should be exceedingly rare]
    Plan B:
        a) Integrate myCompleteDays with tree completion reserve

Day correction for seeding: [use flag]
    DEBATABLE!
        a) -1 day for seed
        b_ -2 days for seedNext

Improve growSunCover() for trees having/reaching maxTreeSize:
    a) For loss of suns, moreDays = Player.moreDays - Player.myCompleteDays
        [Effect debatable with compactComplete]

Wait implementer:
    a) Wait before moves [BEGINNER]
    b) Wait in-between moves [LEGEND!]
        -> Check time complexity
        -> Estimate opp growing trees within that time
            (i) Defense mode, (ii) Offense mode, (iii) Balanced mode(??)
    PRACTICAL SOLUTION:
        a) Keep a small wait ahead coeff (2 or 3)
        b) Increase shadowAheadCoeff accordingly
